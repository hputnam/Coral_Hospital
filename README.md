Understanding the response of the coral holobiont to environmental change is crucial to aid conservation efforts. The most pressing problem is “coral bleaching”, usually precipitated by prolonged thermal stress. We used metabolomics to investigate how the coral species Montipora capitata and Pocillopora acuta respond to heat stress with the goal of identifying diagnostic markers prior to bleaching onset. Untargeted metabolomics identified a variety of co-regulated dipeptides as having the highest differential accumulation in both species. The structures of four dipeptides were determined and these showed differential accumulation in symbiotic and aposymbiotic (alga free) Aiptasia, suggesting their deep evolutionary origins and involvement in symbiosis. These and other metabolites can be used as diagnostic markers for thermal stress in wild coral.

This repository contains physical environmental data (temperature, light, pH, and flow), coral color score data, and analytical code as described in the methods of Williams et al.
